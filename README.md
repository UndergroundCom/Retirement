# State of Underground.
By: O2

Underground has long been regarded as the chat system of the southern United States and as we near our two-year anniversary and as Underground declines we have decided to make Underground a legacy item. This means we will shutdown the server. Underground.bat/.exe will not be available to consumers, and we will not be active on the Underground Installer. We love Underground but the popularity declines and some speed bumps the program has run into has prompted us to shut down the system. We wish the best to our users, fans, moderators, and developers.

Sincerely,
	        O2
